The\\ncompact design and touch-based interactivity seemed like a leap into the future.\\nBefore long, smartphones became a way of life for organizations worldwide\\nbecause of all they offer for business productivity and communication. Generative\\nAI (artificial intelligence) promises a similar leap in productivity and the emergence\\nof new modes of working and creating.\\nTools such as Midjourney and ChatGPT are gaining attention for their capabilities in\\ngenerating realistic images, video and sophisticated, human-like text, extending\\nthe limits of AI’s creative potential. Generative AI represents a significant\\nadvancement in deep learning and AI development, with some suggesting it’s a\\nThink\\nYour privacy choices\\n7/18/24, 12:59 PM\\nGenerative AI use cases for the enterprise - IBM Blog\\nhttps://www.ibm.com/blog/generative-ai-use-cases/\\n3/15\\nmove towards developing “strong AI.” This evolution demonstrates that computers\\nhave moved beyond mere number-crunching devices. They are now capable of\\nnatural language processing (NLP), grasping context and exhibiting elements of\\ncreativity.\\nFor example, organizations can use generative AI to:\\xa0\\nQuickly turn mountains of unstructured text into specific and usable document\\nsummaries, paving the way for more informed decision-making.\\nAutomate tedious, repetitive tasks.\\nStreamline workflows with personalized content creation, tailored product\\ndescriptions and market-ready copy.\\nDesign content, ad campaigns and innovative products that build better\\ncustomer experiences.\\nDemystifying generative AI\\nAt the heart of Generative AI lie massive databases of texts, images, code and\\nother data types. This data is fed into generational models, and there are a few to\\nchoose from, each developed to excel at a specific task. Generative adversarial\\nnetworks (GANs) or variational autoencoders (VAEs) are used for images, videos,\\n3D models and music. Autoregressive models or large language models (LLMs) are\\nused for text and language.\\nLike diligent students, these generative models soak up information and identify\\npatterns, structures and relationships between data points, which is how they learn\\nthe grammar of poetry, artistic brushstrokes and musical melodies.\\nGenerative AI uses advanced machine learning algorithms and techniques to\\nanalyze patterns and build statistical models. Imagine each data point as a glowing\\norb placed on a vast, multi-dimensional landscape. The model meticulously maps\\nthese orbs, calculating the relative heights, valleys, smooth slopes and jagged cliffs\\nto create a probability map, a guidebook for predicting where the next orb (i.e., the\\ngenerated content) should most likely land.\\nNow, when the user provides a prompt—a word, a sketch, a musical snippet or a\\nline of code—the prompt acts like a beacon, drawing the model towards a specific\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\nOverview\\nThink 2024\\nOverview\\nExperience\\nAgenda\\nPartner Day\\nThink on Tour\\nFAQ\\nArtificial intelligence\\nCloud\\nSecurity\\nSustainability\\nBlog\\nCategories\\nAnalytics\\nArtificial intelligence\\nAutomation\\nBusiness transformation\\nCloud\\nSecurity\\nSocial impact\\nSupply chain\\nSustainability\\nIndustries\\nEnergy and utilities\\nFinancial services\\nGovernment\\nHealthcare\\nManufacturing\\nMedia and entertainment\\nMining and extraction\\nTechnology\\nTelecommunications\\nTransportation\\nView all blog posts\\nVideos\\nOverview\\nAI Academy\\nRethink use cases\\nThink 2024 on demand\\nEvents\\nThink 2024\\nThink on Tour\\nTechXchange\\nMore\\nYour privacy choices\\n7/18/24, 12:59 PM\\nGenerative AI use cases for the enterprise - IBM Blog\\nhttps://www.ibm.com/blog/generative-ai-use-cases/\\n4/15\\nregion on that probability map; the model then navigates this landscape,\\nprobabilistically choosing the next element, the next and the next, guided by the\\npatterns it learned and the nudge of the users’ prompt.\\nEach output is unique yet statistically tethered to the data the model learned from.\\nIt’s not just copying and pasting; it’s creatively building upon a foundation of\\nknowledge fueled by probability and the guiding prompt. While advanced models\\ncan handle diverse data types, some excel at specific tasks, like text generation,\\ninformation summary or image creation.\\nThe quality of outputs depends heavily on training data, adjusting the model’s\\nparameters and prompt engineering, so responsible data sourcing and bias\\nmitigation are crucial. Imagine training a generative AI model on a dataset of only\\nromance novels. The result will be unusable if a user prompts the model to write a\\nfactual news article.\\nHarnessing the value of generative AI\\nGenerative AI is a potent tool, but how do organizations harness this power? There\\nare two paths most businesses are traveling to realize the value of generative AI:\\nReady-to-launch tools:\\nThe “AI for everyone” option: Platforms like ChatGPT and Synthesia.io come pre-\\ntrained on vast datasets, allowing users to tap into their generative capabilities\\nwithout building and training models from scratch. Organizations can fine-tune\\nthese models with specific data, nudging them towards outputs tailored to\\nparticular business needs. User-friendly interfaces and integration tools make\\nthem accessible even for non-technical folks.\\nThese public options offer limited control, less customization of model behavior\\nand outputs and the potential for bias inherited from the pre-trained models.\\nCustom-trained models:\\nTopics\\nAnalytics\\nAsset management\\nBusiness automation\\nCompute and servers\\nDevOps\\nIT automation\\nMiddleware\\nNetwork\\nQuantum\\nStorage\\nContent types\\nExplainers\\nNewsletters\\nPodcasts\\nReference architectures\\nView all\\nSubscribe\\nYour privacy choices\\n7/18/24, 12:59 PM\\nGenerative AI use cases for the enterprise - IBM Blog\\nhttps://www.ibm.com/blog/generative-ai-use-cases/\\n5/15\\nMost organizations can’t produce or support AI without a strong partnership.\\nInnovators who want a custom AI can pick a “foundation model” like OpenAI’s\\nGPT-3 or BERT and feed it their data. This personalized training sculpts the model\\ninto bespoke generative AI perfectly aligned with business goals. The process\\ndemands high-level skills and resources, but the results are more likely to be\\ncompliant, custom-tailored and business-specific.\\nThe best option for an enterprise organization depends on its specific needs,\\nresources and technical capabilities. If speed, affordability and ease of use are\\npriorities, ready-to-launch tools might be the best choice. Custom-trained models\\nmight improve if customization, control and bias mitigation are critical.\\nAdopt a use-case-driven approach to\\ngenerative AI\\nThe key to success lies in adopting a use-case-driven approach, focusing on your\\ncompany’s problems and how generative AI can solve them.\\nKey considerations:\\nTech stack: Ensure your existing technology infrastructure can handle the\\ndemands of AI models and data processing.\\nModel matchmaking: Choose a suitable generative AI model for your specific\\nneeds.\\nTeamwork: Assemble a team with expertise in AI, data science and your\\nindustry. This interdisciplinary team will help to ensure your generative AI is a\\nsuccess.\\nData: High-quality, relevant data is the fuel that powers generative AI success.\\nInvest in data hygiene and collection strategies to keep your engine running\\nsmoothly.

This includes technical documentation, user manuals and\\nother relevant materials that accompany software development.\\nProduct development: Generative AI is increasingly utilized by product\\ndesigners for optimizing design concepts on a large scale. This technology\\nenables rapid evaluation and automatic adjustments, streamlining the design\\nprocess significantly. It assists in structural optimization which ensures that\\nproducts are strong, durable and use minimal material, leading to considerable\\ncost reductions. To have the greatest impact, generative design must be\\nintegrated throughout the product development cycle, from the initial concept\\nto manufacturing and procurement. Additionally, product managers are\\nemploying generative AI to synthesize user feedback, allowing for product\\nimprovements that are directly influenced by user needs and preferences.\\nSales and marketing: Generative AI is assisting marketing campaigns by\\nenabling hyper-personalized communication with both potential and existing\\ncustomers across a variety of channels, including email, social media and SMS.\\nThis technology not only streamlines campaign execution but also enhances\\nthe ability to scale up content creation without sacrificing quality. In the realm\\nof sales, generative AI boosts team performance by providing deep analytics\\nand insights into customer behavior. Marketing departments are harnessing\\nthis technology to sift through data, understand consumer behavior patterns\\nand craft content that truly connects with their audience, which often involves\\nsuggesting news stories or best practices that align with audience interests.\\n•\\n•\\n•\\nYour privacy choices\\n7/18/24, 12:59 PM\\nGenerative AI use cases for the enterprise - IBM Blog\\nhttps://www.ibm.com/blog/generative-ai-use-cases/\\n7/15\\nGenerative AI plays a crucial role in dynamically targeting and segmenting\\naudiences and identifying high-quality leads, significantly improving the\\neffectiveness of marketing strategies and outreach efforts. In addition, Well-\\ndeveloped prompts and inputs direct generative models to output creative\\ncontent for emails, blogs, social media posts and websites. Existing content\\ncan be reimagined and edited using AI tools. Organizations can also create\\ncustom generative AI language generators trained on their brand’s tone and\\nvoice to match previous brand content more accurately.\\xa0\\nProject management and operations: Generative AI tools can support project\\nmanagers with automation within their platforms. Benefits include automatic\\ntask and subtask generation, leveraging historical project data to forecast\\ntimelines and requirements, note taking and risk prediction. Generative AI\\nallows project managers to search through and create instant summaries of\\nessential business documents. This use case saves time and enables users to\\nfocus on higher-level strategy rather than daily business management.\\nGraphic design and video: With its ability to create realistic images and\\nstreamline animation, generative AI will be the go-to tool for creating videos\\nwithout needing actors, video equipment or editing expertise. AI video\\ngenerators can instantly create videos in whatever languages they need to\\nserve each region. It will be a while before generative AI-created videos can\\neffectively replace human actors and directors, but organizations are already\\nexperimenting with the technology. Users also use image generators to edit\\npersonal photos to create professional-looking business headshots for\\nbusiness use on Slack or LinkedIn.\\nBusiness and employee management: In customer service, generative AI can\\nbe used throughout the call center. It can make necessary documentation easy\\nto access and search, putting case-resolving information at the fingertips of\\nsupport agents. Generative AI-powered tools can significantly improve\\nemployee-manager interactions. They can structure performance reviews,\\noffering managers and employees a more transparent framework for feedback\\nand growth. Additionally, generative conversational AI portals can provide\\nemployees with feedback and identify areas for improvement without involving\\nmanagement.\\nCustomer support and customer service: While chatbots are still widely used,\\norganizations have started merging technologies to change how chatbots work.\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\nYour privacy choices\\n7/18/24, 12:59 PM\\nGenerative AI use cases for the enterprise - IBM Blog\\nhttps://www.ibm.com/blog/generative-ai-use-cases/\\n8/15\\nGenerative AI advancements aid the creation of more innovative chatbots that\\ncan engage in naturally flowing conversations, enabling them to understand\\ncontext and nuance similar to how a human representative would. Generative\\nAI-powered chatbots can access and process vast amounts of information to\\nanswer customer and agent queries accurately; unlike human agents, AI\\nchatbots can handle customer inquiries around the clock to provide a seamless\\nuser experience, night or day. The shift from traditional chatbots to generative\\nAI-powered companions is still in its early stages, but the potential is\\nundeniable. As technology evolves, we can expect even more sophisticated and\\nengaging AI interactions, blurring the lines between virtual and human\\nassistance.\\nFraud detection and risk management: Generative AI can quickly scan and\\nsummarize large amounts of data to identify patterns or anomalies.\\nUnderwriters and claims adjusters can use generative AI tools to scour policies\\nand claims to optimize client outcomes. Generative AI can generate custom\\nreports and summaries tailored to specific needs and provide relevant\\ninformation directly to underwriters, adjusters and risk managers, saving time\\nand simplifying decision-making. However, human judgment and oversight are\\nstill necessary for making final decisions and ensuring fair outcomes.\\nGenerating synthetic data for training and testing: Enterprises can leverage\\nAI to generate synthetic data for training AI models, testing new products and\\nsimulating real-world scenarios. This can reduce reliance on actual data, which\\nmay be sensitive and must remain private or come from an expensive external\\ndata source. No longer bound by the limitations of gathering and preparing\\nreal-world data, development cycles can be accelerated. With readily available\\nsynthetic data sets, companies can rapidly iterate on AI models, test new\\nfeatures and bring solutions to market faster.\\nHere are key takeaways for the ethical implementation of your organization’s\\ngenerative AI use cases:\\nProtect sensitive data:\\xa0Use only depersonalized and nonsensitive data to avoid\\nexposing vulnerable information and comply with regulations.\\nStay informed:\\xa0Follow industry news to identify reliable tools and avoid\\nunethical AI practices.\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\nYour privacy choices\\n7/18/24, 12:59 PM\\nGenerative AI use cases for the enterprise - IBM Blog\\nhttps://www.ibm.com/blog/generative-ai-use-cases/\\n9/15\\nDevelop an AI policy:\\xa0Create guidelines for internal AI use and investments in\\nthird-party tools, drawing from available templates.\\nInvest in upskilling: Investment in reskilling and upskilling programs is crucial,\\nempowering workers to develop skills resistant to automation.\\nBest practices are evolving rapidly.

Early genAI models were built\\nwith specific data types and applications in mind. For example, Google’s DeepDream <\\nhttps://deepdreamgenerator.com/> was designed to manipulate and enhance images. It can produce engaging,\\nnew visual effects, but the model’s development was primarily focused on image processing, and its capabilities\\ndo not apply to other types of data.\\nThe field of generative AI is evolving quickly, however, and an increasing number of generative AI models are now\\nmultimodal < https://www.techopedia.com/definition/multimodal-ai-multimodal-artificial-intelligence> .

A multidisciplinary approach helps ensure that generative AI models are designed, trained, deployed,\\nand maintained ethically and responsibly.\\nGenerative AI vs. Traditional AI\\nEssentially, the relationship between artificial intelligence and generative AI is hierarchical.\\xa0\\nAI refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that previously required human\\nintelligence.

Many traditional ML algorithms are trained to generate a single, correct output.\\nIn contrast, generative AI uses deep learning < https://www.techopedia.com/definition/30325/deep-learning> (DL)\\nstrategies capable of learning from diverse datasets and producing outputs that fall within an acceptable range.\\nThis flexibility allows the same foundation model < https://www.techopedia.com/definition/34826/foundation-\\nmodel> to be used for various tasks. For example, ChatGPT <\\nhttps://www.techopedia.com/definition/34933/chatgpt> can now process image and text prompts.\\xa0\\nThe technology, a subset of ML, is already used to produce imaginative digital art, design new virtual\\nenvironments, create musical compositions, formulate written content, assist in drug discovery by predicting\\nmolecular structures, write software code, and generate realistic video and audio clips.\\xa0\\nHow Does Generative AI Work?\\nGenerative AI models use neural networks < https://www.techopedia.com/can-neural-networks-really-think-like-\\nhumans> to learn patterns in data and generate new content. Once trained, the neural network can generate\\ncontent similar to the data it was trained on. For example, a neural network trained on a dataset of text can be\\nused to generate new text, and depending on the model’s input, the text output can take the form of a poem, a\\nstory, a complex mathematical calculation < https://www.techopedia.com/how-chatgpts-new-code-interpreter-\\nlowers-the-barriers-for-data-science> , or even programming code for software applications. <\\nhttps://www.techopedia.com/how-ai-generated-code-is-creating-a-new-revolution-in-cloud-applications>\\nThe usefulness of genAI outputs depends heavily on the quality and comprehensiveness of the training data, the\\nmodel’s architecture, the processes used to train the model, and the\\xa0 prompts human users give the model <\\nhttps://www.techopedia.com/how-to/how-to-write-ai-prompts> .\\nData quality < https://www.techopedia.com/definition/14653/data-quality> is essential because that’s what genAI\\nmodels use to learn how to generate high-quality outputs. The more diverse and comprehensive the training data,\\nthe more patterns and nuances the model will potentially be able to understand and replicate. When a model is\\ntrained on inconsistent, biased < https://www.techopedia.com/definition/33036/machine-bias> , or noisy data, it’s\\nlikely to produce outputs that mirror these flaws.\\xa0\\n7/18/24, 1:42 PM\\nWhat is Generative AI (GenAI)? - Definition from Techopedia\\nhttps://www.techopedia.com/definition/34633/generative-ai\\n3/23\\nTraining methodologies and evaluation strategies are also crucial. During training, the model uses feedback to\\nadjust values within the model’s architecture (internal parameters <\\nhttps://www.techopedia.com/definition/3725/parameter-param> ).\\nThe complexity of the model’s architecture can also play a significant role in output usefulness because the\\nmodel’s architecture determines how the genAI processes and learns from training data.\\xa0\\nOn one hand, if the architecture is too simple, the model may struggle to capture important contextual nuances in\\nthe training data.\\nOn the other hand, if the architecture is overly complex, the model may overfit <\\nhttps://www.techopedia.com/definition/32512/overfitting> and prioritize irrelevant details at the expense of\\nimportant, underlying patterns.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOnce trained, the model can be given prompts for creating new data. Prompts are how people interact with AI\\nmodels and guide their output. The focus of a prompt depends on the desired output, the model’s purpose, and\\nthe context in which the model is being used. For example, if the desired output is a cover letter, the prompt might\\ninclude directions for writing style and word length. However, if the desired output is an audio clip, the prompt\\nmight include directions for musical genre and tempo < https://www.techopedia.com/how-can-an-ai-model-create-\\nmusic> .\\xa0\\nBest Practices for Writing GenAI Prompts\\nA prompt is an input statement or cue that guides a genAI model’s output <\\nhttps://www.techopedia.com/definition/prompt-engineering> . GenAI models use prompts to generate new, original\\ncontent statistically aligned with the context and requirements specified in the prompt.\\nWhile the specific details in a prompt reflect the type of desired output, best practices for writing text, image, audio,\\nand video prompts rely on the same basic principles.\\nBe Precise: The more specific and detailed the prompt, the more tailored the response will likely be.\\nProvide Context: Context reduces ambiguity and helps the model generate outputs meeting the prompter’s\\nintent.\\xa0\\nAvoid Leading Questions: It’s important to craft prompts that are objective and free from leading information.\\xa0\\nReframe and Iterate Prompts: If the model doesn’t return a useful response the first time, try rephrasing the\\nprompt (or changing the base multimedia sample) and try again.\\xa0\\nAdjust Temperature Settings: Some AI platforms allow users to adjust temperature settings. Higher\\ntemperatures produce more random outputs, and lower temperatures produce more deterministic outputs.\\nLimit Response Length: When seeking concise outputs, craft prompts that specify constraints, such as word or\\ncharacter counts for text or duration limits for audio outputs.\\nExperiment with Multiple Prompts: Breaking a question or instruction down into several smaller prompts <\\nhttps://www.techopedia.com/enhancing-ais-cognitive-abilities-through-chain-of-thought-reasoning> or trying out\\ndifferent base images, audio clips, and video samples will often yield more useful outputs.\\nReview and Revise Outputs: Generative AI outputs should always be reviewed because most genAI responses\\nwill need to be edited before they can be used. Be prepared to spend time on this important step!\\nTypes of Generative AI\\xa0\\nGenerative AI can be applied to a wide range of tasks, and each type of task may require a different deep-learning\\narchitectural design to capture the specific patterns and features of the training data <\\nhttps://www.techopedia.com/the-pitfalls-of-training-ai-with-made-up-data> . Generative Adversarial Networks\\n7/18/24, 1:42 PM\\nWhat is Generative AI (GenAI)? - Definition from Techopedia\\nhttps://www.techopedia.com/definition/34633/generative-ai\\n4/23\\n(GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Transformer architectures are important for building generative AI\\nmodels.\\xa0\\nEach type of architecture aims to get the AI model to a point where it can produce samples that are\\nindistinguishable from the data it is being trained on.\\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs) < https://www.techopedia.com/definition/32515/generative-adversarial-\\nnetwork-gan> consist of two neural networks < https://www.techopedia.com/a-laymens-guide-to-neural-\\nnetworks/2/33260> : a generator and a discriminator. The two networks play a guessing game in which the\\ngenerator gives the discriminator a data sample, and the discriminator predicts whether the sample is real or\\nsomething the generator made up. The process is repeated until the generator can fool the discriminator with an\\nacceptable level of accuracy.\\xa0\\nVariational Autoencoders (VAEs) < https://www.techopedia.com/definition/33285/variational-autoencoder-vae> are\\ncomposed of two main components: an encoder and a decoder. The encoder takes input data and compresses it\\ninto a latent space representation that preserves its most important features. The decoder then takes the latent\\nspace representation < https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-latent-space-in-machine-learning-\\nde5a7c687d8d> and generates new data that captures the most important features of the training data.\\nTransformer architectures < https://www.techopedia.com/definition/34952/transformer-model-machine-learning>\\nconsist of multiple stacked layers, each containing its own self-attention mechanism and feed-forward network.\\nThe self-attention mechanism enables each element in a sequence to consider and weigh its relationship with all\\nother elements, and the feed-forward network processes the output of the self-attention mechanism and performs\\nadditional transformations on the data. As the model processes an input sequence through the stacked layers, it\\nlearns to generate new sequences that capture the most important information for the task.\\nGenerative Pre-trained Transformers < https://www.techopedia.com/gpt-series-evolution-insights> (GPTs) are a\\nspecific implementation of the transformer architecture. This type of model is first pre-trained on vast amounts of\\ntext data to capture linguistic patterns and nuances. Once the foundation training has been completed, the model\\nis then fine-tuned for a specific use.\\xa0\\nHybrid variations of generative AI architectures are becoming increasingly common as researchers continually\\nseek to improve model performance, stability, and efficiency.\\nFor example, GPT was not inherently designed for multimodal AI. Still, OpenAI <\\nhttps://www.techopedia.com/who-owns-openai> has been able to extend the large language model’s <\\nhttps://www.techopedia.com/definition/34948/large-language-model-llm> infrastructure by integrating a generative\\nAI architecture capable of understanding images.\\n7/18/24, 1:42 PM\\nWhat is Generative AI (GenAI)? - Definition from Techopedia\\nhttps://www.techopedia.com/definition/34633/generative-ai\\n5/23\\nHow Are Generative AI Models Trained?\\nOnce the architecture for a generative AI model has been established, the model undergoes training. Throughout\\nthis phase, the model learns how to adjust its internal parameters to minimize statistical discrepancies between\\nthe model’s outputs and the data it was trained on. The goal is to minimize the loss function <\\nhttps://www.datarobot.com/blog/introduction-to-loss-functions/> , the statistical difference between the model’s\\noutputs and the data it was trained on.\\xa0\\nGenerative Adversarial Networks are trained through a two-step process. The generator network learns how to\\ncreate fake data from random noise. At the same time, the discriminator network learns the difference between\\nreal and fake data. The result is a generator network capable of creating high-quality, realistic data samples.\\nVariational Autoencoders (VAEs) are also trained through a two-part process. The encoder network maps input\\ndata to a latent space, where it’s represented as a probability distribution. The decoder network then samples from\\nthis distribution to reconstruct the input data. During training, VAEs seek to minimize a loss function that includes\\ntwo components: reconstruction and regularization. The balance between reconstruction and regularization allows\\nVAEs to generate new data samples by sampling from the learned latent space.\\nTransformer Models are trained with a two-step process, as well. First, they are pre-trained on a large dataset.\\nThen, they are fine-tuned with a smaller, task-specific dataset. The combination of pre-training and fine-tuning\\nallows transformer models to use supervised < https://www.techopedia.com/definition/30389/supervised-learning>\\n, unsupervised < https://www.techopedia.com/definition/30390/unsupervised-learning> , and semi-supervised\\nlearning < https://www.techopedia.com/why-is-semi-supervised-learning-a-helpful-model-for-machine-\\n7/18/24, 1:42 PM\\nWhat is Generative AI (GenAI)? - Definition from Techopedia\\nhttps://www.techopedia.com/definition/34633/generative-ai\\n6/23\\nlearning/7/33192> , depending on the available data and the specific task. This flexibility enables the same\\ntransformer model to be used for different types of content.\\nHybrid Generative AI Models are trained with a combination of techniques. The exact details for training a\\nhybrid generative AI model will vary depending on the specific architecture, its objectives, and the data type\\ninvolved.\\xa0\\nHow Are Generative AI Models Evaluated?\\nGenAI outputs need to be assessed objectively and subjectively < https://www.techopedia.com/how-your-\\nfeedback-transforms-lms-like-chatgpt> for relevance and quality. Depending on what is learned from the\\nevaluation, a model might need to be fine-tuned to improve performance < https://www.techopedia.com/how-does-\\ntransfer-learning-benefit-ai-models-in-leveraging-knowledge> or retrained with additional data. If necessary, the\\nmodel’s architecture might also be revisited.\\nEvaluation is typically done using a separate dataset known as a\\xa0validation <\\nhttps://www.techopedia.com/definition/33278/validation-set> or test set, which contains data the model hasn’t\\nseen during training. The goal is to determine how well the model performs with new, previously unseen data.\\xa0\\nA good evaluation score indicates that the model has learned meaningful patterns from the training data and can\\napply that knowledge to generate a useful output when given a new input prompt.\\nPopular metrics for assessing generative AI model performance include quantitative and/or qualitative scores for\\nthe following criteria:\\nInception (IS) Score assesses the quality and diversity of generated images.\\nFréchet Inception Distance (FID) Score assesses the similarity between the feature representations of real and\\ngenerated data.\\nPrecision and Recall Scores assess how well-generated data samples match real data distribution.\\nKernel Density Estimation (KDE) estimates the distribution of generated data and compares it to real data\\ndistribution.\\nStructural Similarity Index (SSIM) computes feature-based distances between real and generated images.\\nBLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) Scores quantify the similarity between the machine-generated\\ntranslation and one or more reference translations provided by human translators.\\nROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) Scores measure the similarity between a\\nmachine-generated summary and one or more reference summaries provided by human annotators.\\nPerplexity Scores measure how well the model predicts a given sequence of words.\\nIntrinsic Evaluation assesses the model’s performance on intermediate sub-tasks within a broader application.\\nExtrinsic Evaluation assesses the model’s performance on the overall task it is designed for.\\nFew-Shot or Zero-Shot Learning assesses the model’s ability to perform tasks with very limited or no training\\nexamples < https://www.techopedia.com/definition/34949/zero-shot-one-shot-few-shot-learning> .\\nOut-of-Distribution Detection assesses the model’s ability to detect out-of-distribution or anomalous data\\npoints.\\nReconstruction Loss Scores measure how well the model can reconstruct input data from the learned latent\\nspace < https://www.baeldung.com/cs/dl-latent-space> .\\n7/18/24, 1:42 PM\\nWhat is Generative AI (GenAI)? - Definition from Techopedia\\nhttps://www.techopedia.com/definition/34633/generative-ai\\n7/23\\n\\xa0It is often necessary to use a combination of metrics to get a complete picture of a model’s strengths and\\nweaknesses, and the choice of evaluation method depends on the specific model’s architecture and purpose. For\\nexample, Inception Score and FID are commonly used to evaluate the performance of image generation models.\\nIn contrast, BLEU and ROUGE are commonly used to assess the performance of text generation models.\\nGenAI and the Turing Test\\nThe Turing test < https://www.techopedia.com/definition/200/turing-test> can also be used to assess a generative\\nAI model’s performance. This test, which Dr. Alan Turing introduced in his 1950 paper, “Computing Machinery and\\nIntelligence,” was initially designed to test a machine’s ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from a\\nhuman’s < https://www.techopedia.com/can-an-ai-chatbot-really-pass-for-a-person/7/33410> .\\nIn the test’s traditional form, a human judge engages in a text-based conversation with both a human and a\\nmachine and tries to determine which responses were generated by the human and which responses were\\ngenerated by the machine.\\xa0\\nIf the human judge cannot accurately determine which responses came from the machine, the machine is said to\\nhave passed the Turing Test.\\nWhile the Turing Test is historically significant and easy to understand, it cannot be used as the sole assessment\\nbecause it focuses purely on natural language processing < https://www.techopedia.com/definition/653/natural-\\nlanguage-processing-nlp> (NLP) and does not cover the full range of tasks that generative AI models can\\nperform.\\xa0\\nAnother problem with using the Turing test to assess genAI is that generative AI outputs only sometimes aim to\\nreplicate human behavior. DALL·E < https://www.techopedia.com/definition/dall-e> , for example, was built to\\ncreate new, imaginative images from text prompts. Its outputs were never designed to replicate human\\nresponses.\\xa0\\nPopular Real-world Uses for Generative AI\\nWhen generative AI is used as a productivity tool, it can be categorized as a type of augmented artificial\\nintelligence < https://www.techopedia.com/definition/augmented-intelligence> .\\xa0\\nPopular real-world uses for this type of augmented intelligence include:\\xa0\\nImage Generation: Quickly generate and/or manipulate a series of images <\\nhttps://www.techopedia.com/ai/best-ai-art-generator> to explore new creative possibilities.\\xa0\\nText Generation: Generate news articles < https://www.techopedia.com/ai-journalism-where-will-the-rise-of-\\nautomated-news-writing-and-fact-checking-take-the-industry> and other types of text formats in different writing\\nstyles.\\xa0\\nData Augmentation: Generate synthetic data to train machine learning models <\\nhttps://www.techopedia.com/definition/33305/synthetic-data> when real data is limited or expensive.\\xa0\\xa0\\nDrug Discovery: Generate virtual molecular structures and chemical compounds to speed up the discovery of\\nnew pharmaceuticals < https://www.techopedia.com/the-role-ai-can-play-in-pharmaceutical-discovery> .\\nMusic Composition: Help composers explore new musical ideas by generating original pieces of music <\\nhttps://www.techopedia.com/ai-in-music-sparks-industry-revolution-heres-what-big-players-think> .\\nStyle Transfer: Apply different artistic styles < https://www.techopedia.com/what-is-the-impact-of-ai-on-\\nart/2/33399> to the same piece of content.\\xa0\\nVR/AR Development: Create virtual avatars and environments for video games, augmented reality platforms,\\nand metaverse gaming < https://www.techopedia.com/metaverse-gaming-the-future-of-these-brave-new-virtual-\\nworlds> .\\xa0\\nMedical Images: Analyze medical images and issue reports of the analysis < https://www.techopedia.com/ai-\\nin-radiology-the-key-to-tackling-the-global-shortage-of-radiologists> .\\xa0\\n7/18/24, 1:42 PM\\nWhat is Generative AI (GenAI)? - Definition from Techopedia\\nhttps://www.techopedia.com/definition/34633/generative-ai\\n8/23\\nContent Recommendation: Create personalized recommendations < https://www.techopedia.com/first-time-\\nrecommender-systems-and-the-cold-start-problem> for e-commerce and entertainment platforms.\\nLanguage Translation: Translate text < https://www.techopedia.com/metas-ai-powered-seamlessm4t-one-\\nstep-closer-to-universal-language-translation> from one language to another.\\xa0\\xa0\\nProduct Design: Generate new product designs and concepts virtually < https://www.techopedia.com/ai-\\npowered-text-to-cad-may-take-architecture-to-new-heights> to save time and money.\\n\\xa0Anomaly Detection: Create virtual models of normal data patterns that will make it easier for other AI\\nprograms to identify defects in manufactured products or discover unusual patterns in finance and cybersecurity\\n< https://www.techopedia.com/how-to-train-your-anomaly-detection-system-to-learn-normal-behavior-in-time-\\nseries-data/2/34288> .\\nCustomer Experience Management: Use generative chatbots to answer customer questions and respond to\\ncustomer feedback < https://www.techopedia.com/we-asked-it-pros-how-enterprises-will-use-chatbots-in-the-\\nfuture-heres-what-they-said/2/33316> .\\nHealthcare: Generate personalized treatment plans based on multimodal patient data <\\nhttps://www.techopedia.com/leveraging-multimodal-ai-for-enhanced-healthcare-decision-making> .\\xa0\\nBenefits and Challenges of Using Generative AI\\nThe transformative impact of Generative AI is already creating new types of educational, business, and research\\nopportunities. The impact is also raising some important concerns.\\nOn the positive side, generative AI technology is already being used to enhance productivity and hopefully allow\\npeople to redirect their time and energy towards more high-value tasks. In research fields where data is either\\nlimited or costly to procure, Generative AI simulates or augments data and helps speed up research outcomes <\\nhttps://www.techopedia.com/how-ai-can-revolutionize-the-drug-discovery-process> .\\xa0\\nIn manufacturing, generative models are used to generate virtual prototypes <\\nhttps://www.techopedia.com/toyotas-ai-powered-breakthroughs-in-automotive-design> ; in the enterprise, genAI is\\nused to customize marketing messages < https://www.techopedia.com/the-strategic-approach-to-ai-in-the-\\nenterprise> based on individual preferences.\\nOn the negative side, malicious actors have been abusing the technology < https://www.techopedia.com/the-\\nfuture-of-dark-ai-tools-what-to-expect-next> to clone voices < https://www.techopedia.com/tips-for-better-security-\\nnow-that-ai-clones-our-voices> and conduct phishing exploits < https://www.techopedia.com/how-poisongpt-and-\\nwormgpt-brought-the-generative-ai-boogeyman-to-life> . Misuse of the technology is problematic because it has\\nthe potential to disrupt trust < https://www.techopedia.com/what-will-it-take-to-trust-ai-overcoming-ai-fears-\\nuncertainty-and-doubts> and potentially upend economic, social, and political institutions.\\nCritical post-deployment considerations include monitoring the model for misuse and putting safeguards in place\\nto balance the need for progress with responsible AI < https://www.techopedia.com/the-ethical-ai-dilemma-striking-\\nthe-balance-between-progress-and-responsibility> .\\xa0\\nIt’s expected that many of the most popular genAI models will require frequent updates to avoid concept drift <\\nhttps://www.techopedia.com/what-are-some-factors-that-contribute-to-ai-drift/7/32970> and retain their ability <\\nhttps://www.techopedia.com/is-gpt-4-a-flop> to produce high-quality, relevant outputs.\\xa0\\n7/18/24, 1:42 PM\\nWhat is Generative AI (GenAI)? - Definition from Techopedia\\nhttps://www.techopedia.com/definition/34633/generative-ai\\n9/23\\nWill Generative AI Replace Humans in the Workplace?\\nGenerative AI has already demonstrated the potential to transform the way people work <\\nhttps://www.techopedia.com/the-ripple-effect-of-generative-ai-in-the-workplace> .\\xa0\\nProponents of the technology argue that while generative AI will replace humans in some jobs <\\nhttps://www.techopedia.com/generative-ai-will-replace-2-5-million-jobs-in-the-u-s-by-2030> , it will create new jobs\\n< https://www.techopedia.com/the-future-of-work-in-the-age-of-ai> . People will still be required to choose the right\\ntraining data, and select the most appropriate architecture for the generative task at hand – and people will always\\nplay an important role in evaluating model outputs.\\nMany critics worry that because generative AI can emulate different writing and visual styles <\\nhttps://www.techopedia.com/heres-how-generative-ai-is-reshaping-hollywood-entertainment> , the technology will\\neventually decrease the financial value of human-created content.\\xa0\\nIn fact, generative AI played a significant role in the recent writer’s strike in the United States. The strike lasted for\\nnearly five months and was the longest writer’s strike in Hollywood history.\\nOne of the critical issues in the strike was the use of AI in writers’ rooms < https://www.techopedia.com/ai/best-ai-\\nstory-generator> . As AI-powered writing tools became increasingly easy to use < https://www.techopedia.com/6-\\nfree-generative-ai-tools-that-are-great-for-beginners> , some studios began using them to generate and rewrite\\nexisting scripts.\\xa0\\nWriters were concerned that using AI would lead to job losses and a decline in the quality of content <\\nhttps://www.techopedia.com/ai-text-generators-a-blessing-or-a-curse-for-writers> .\\xa0\\nQuestions about the ownership of AI-generated content < https://www.techopedia.com/copyright-ruling-when-\\ndoes-human-art-become-ai-art> were also part of the strike. Writers argued that they should be credited and\\ncompensated for any AI-generated content used in edits of their work. Studios argued that AI-generated content is\\nsimply a tool, and writers should not be credited or paid for the use of the tool.\\n7/18/24, 1:42 PM\\nWhat is Generative AI (GenAI)? - Definition from Techopedia\\nhttps://www.techopedia.com/definition/34633/generative-ai\\n10/23\\nUltimately, the writers and studios reached a settlement that included provisions for the acceptable use of genAI <\\nhttps://www.techopedia.com/here-is-why-companies-are-restricting-the-use-of-generative-ai-tools> . While the\\nsettlement did not address all of the writers’ concerns, it did establish the principle that writers should have control\\nover the use of AI in their work. It also helped to raise the general public’s awareness of the potential downsides of\\nAI for the creative industries < https://www.techopedia.com/is-generative-ai-art-actually-art-or-randomly-\\ngenerated-content> .\\nEthical Concerns of Generative AI\\nThe proliferation of generative AI is also raising questions about the ethical use of the technology <\\nhttps://www.techopedia.com/exploring-the-asilomar-ai-principles-a-guide-to-ensuring-safe-and-beneficial-ai-\\ndevelopment> in other industries.\\xa0\\xa0\\nOne of the most disturbing aspects of generative AI is its tendency to hallucinate <\\nhttps://www.techopedia.com/definition/ai-hallucination> and generate irrelevant or incorrect responses.\\xa0\\nAnother concern is its role in the creation and dissemination of deepfakes <\\nhttps://www.techopedia.com/definition/33835/deepfake> . This type of hyper-realistic – yet wholly fabricated –\\ncontent is already being weaponized to spread misinformation < https://www.techopedia.com/the-web-of-\\nmisinformation-turning-the-double-edged-sword> .\\xa0\\nWhile some businesses welcome the potential uses of generative AI < https://www.techopedia.com/whats-driving-\\noffice-workers-toward-embracing-ai> , others are restricting the use of the technology in the workplace to prevent\\nintentional and unintentional data leakage < https://www.techopedia.com/here-is-why-companies-are-restricting-\\nthe-use-of-generative-ai-tools> .\\xa0\\nAlthough integrating GenAI application programming interfaces <\\nhttps://www.techopedia.com/definition/24407/application-programming-interface-api> (APIs) in third-party apps\\nhas made the technology more user-friendly, it has also made it easier for malicious actors to jailbreak generative\\nAI apps < https://www.techopedia.com/what-is-jailbreaking-in-ai-models-like-chatgpt> and create deceptive\\ncontent that features individuals without their knowledge or consent. This type of privacy breach is especially\\negregious because it has the potential to inflict reputational damage.\\nThere’s also an environmental dimension to the ethics of generative AI because it takes a lot of processing power\\nto train generative models < https://www.techopedia.com/ai-explosion-fuels-demand-for-customized-chips> .\\nLarge generative models can require weeks (or even months) of training. It involves using multiple GPUs <\\nhttps://www.techopedia.com/definition/24862/graphics-processing-unit-gpu> and/or TPUs <\\nhttps://www.techopedia.com/definition/32879/tensor-processing-unit-tpu> , which, in turn, consumes a lot of\\nenergy.\\xa0\\nEven though generating outputs in inference mode consumes less energy, the impact on the environment <\\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-computer-scientist-breaks-down-generative-ais-hefty-carbon-\\nfootprint/> still adds up because genAI has already scaled to millions of users every minute of every day.\\nLast but not least, using web scraping < https://www.techopedia.com/definition/5212/web-scraping> to gather data\\nfor training generative AI models < https://www.techopedia.com/ai-powered-web-scraping-how-is-ai-transforming-\\ndata-extraction-and-analysis> has given rise to an entirely new dimension of ethical concerns, especially among\\nweb publishers.\\xa0\\nWeb publishers invest time, effort, and resources to create and curate content. When web content and books are\\nscraped without permission or financial compensation, it essentially amounts to the unauthorized use or theft of\\nintellectual property < https://www.techopedia.com/the-murky-battlefield-of-intellectual-property-theft-and-ai> .\\xa0\\nPublishers’ concerns highlight the need for transparent, consensual, and responsible data collection practices.\\nBalancing technological advancement with rules for the ethical and legal use of genAI technology <\\nhttps://www.techopedia.com/the-chinese-government-establishes-generative-ai-rules-will-other-countries-follow>\\n7/18/24, 1:42 PM\\nWhat is Generative AI (GenAI)? - Definition from Techopedia\\nhttps://www.techopedia.com/definition/34633/generative-ai\\n11/23\\nis expected to be an ongoing challenge that governments, industries, and individuals must address\\ncollaboratively.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nPopular Generative AI Software Apps and Browser Extensions\\xa0\\nDespite concerns about the ethical development, deployment, and use of generative AI technology, genAI\\nsoftware apps, and browser extensions < https://www.techopedia.com/are-your-favorite-browser-extensions-safe-\\nto-use> have gained significant attention due to their versatility and usefulness in various applications.\\xa0\\nPopular Tools for Generating Content\\nChatGPT < https://chat.openai.com/> : This open-source generative AI model <\\nhttps://www.techopedia.com/generative-ai-crossroads-open-source-vs-proprietary-models> developed by OpenAI\\nis known for its ability to generate realistic and coherent text < https://www.techopedia.com/inside-chatgpts-mind-\\nhow-does-it-choose-what-to-say> .

Thus, artificial neural networks attempt to solve\\ncomplicated problems, like summarising documents or recognising faces,\\nwith greater accuracy. You can use the following simple neural network,\\nwhich features a single neuron (aka perceptron)for\\xa0understanding.\\nPerceptrons are a type of artificial neuron that takes several binary inputs\\nlike x1, x2,… Xm and produces a single binary output.\\nx1 ,x2 and Xm are the input values, and w1 and w2 are weights that represent\\nthe strength of each connection to the neuron.

If we want to\\nteach a network how to recognise a car and bike, that would involve a human\\nintroducing the network to lots of examples of what a car and bike look like\\nand tagging (labelling the datasets) those photos accordingly. That’s how the\\nmodel learns to distinguish between cars, bikes, and other details in an\\nimage.\\nHow do Large language models work?\\nLarge Language Model (LLM): A large, general-purpose language model can\\nbe pre-trained and then fine-tuned for specific purposes.

These advancements can be primarily attributed to the three main\\nfactors: methods, data, and scale of computation.\\nFirst, advances in deep learning techniques, specifically transformer architectures, have\\nenabled more powerful and efficient modeling of complex relationships in the data.\\nSecond, the availability of vast and diverse datasets, encompassing extensive text corpora\\nand video repositories, has significantly contributed to the quality and diversity of\\ngenerated outputs. Third, the substantial growth in computational power has played a\\ncrucial role in enabling the training and deployment of increasingly complex generative\\nmodels. Collectively, these technical factors have fueled the rapid evolution of GenAI,\\npaving the way for breakthroughs in various domains of content generation.\\nLanguage Generation\\nLanguage generation builds on the strong foundation of language models, dating back to\\n1948. For instance, the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model, including\\nversions such as GPT-3, 3.5, 4, is a state-of-the-art language model developed by OpenAI.\\nIt relies on a transformer deep learning architecture, designed to process and generate\\nnatural language text. The architecture includes multiple layers of self-attention\\n7/18/24, 1:38 PM\\nGenAI In-Depth: The Science and Capabilities of GenAI | U-M Generative AI\\nhttps://genai.umich.edu/in-depth/science-and-capabilities\\n1/5\\nmechanisms, enabling it to capture the contextual relationships and dependencies\\nbetween words and generate coherent and contextually relevant responses.\\nGPT models have been trained on an extensive corpus of diverse text data of more than\\n400 billion tokens, including books, articles, and web pages, using unsupervised learning\\ntechniques. The training process involves predicting the next word in a sentence based on\\nthe preceding context, enabling the model to learn grammar, semantics, and common\\nlanguage patterns. This pre-training phase equips GPT-3 with a broad understanding of\\nhuman language and knowledge.\\nInstructGPT is a variant of the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model developed\\nby OpenAI. It shares the technical foundation of GPT, utilizing a transformer architecture\\nand unsupervised learning. However, what sets InstructGPT apart is its specific training\\nobjective, which focuses on generating text conditioned on user instructions. During the\\npre-training phase, InstructGPT is trained to predict the next word in a sentence given both\\nthe preceding context and an additional instruction prompt.\\nThis conditioning enables the model to generate text that adheres to specific guidelines\\nprovided by the user. By fine-tuning InstructGPT on custom datasets with specific\\ninstruction-based tasks, it can be tailored to perform a range of practical applications,\\nsuch as generating code, writing essays, answering questions, or providing detailed\\ninstructions. The technical aspects of InstructGPT leverage the power of transformer-\\nbased architectures and instruction conditioning to generate contextually coherent and\\nuser-guided text outputs.\\nMultimodal Generation\\nAdvances have also been made in the space of multimodal GenAI, which includes other\\nmodalities such as audio (including music), images, and video. For instance, CLIP is a\\ntransformer-based model that uses a dual-encoder architecture, and encodes both\\nimages and language. The image encoder processes images by passing them through a\\nconvolutional neural network, while the text encoder utilizes a transformer-based\\narchitecture to process textual descriptions. By performing this process jointly across\\nimages and text, CLIP learns to align their representations in a shared embedding space,\\nwhich allows it to capture meaningful relationships between images and their associated\\ntextual descriptions. By maximizing the similarity between corresponding image-text pairs\\n7/18/24, 1:38 PM\\nGenAI In-Depth: The Science and Capabilities of GenAI | U-M Generative AI\\nhttps://genai.umich.edu/in-depth/science-and-capabilities\\n2/5\\nand minimizing the similarity between non-matching pairs, CLIP learns to understand the\\nsemantic connections between visual and textual data.\\nThe resulting joint embedding space enables a range of applications, including zero-shot\\nimage classification, where CLIP can find the most likely textual description of an image,\\nand zero-shot image retrieval, where it can find images that match a given text query.\\nAnother example of a multimodal GenAI is DALL-E, which combines language models with\\nan image encoder-decoder architecture. DALL-E has the ability to generate novel images\\nbased on textual prompts, showcasing impressive creativity in synthesizing unique and\\nimaginative visuals. By learning a latent space representation of images, DALL-E can\\ngenerate highly detailed and diverse images, transcending conventional image synthesis\\ntechniques.\\nAutonomous GenAI Systems\\nThe first wave of widely adopted GenAI tools such as those introduced above are\\ninteractive or conversational agents that are dependent on human prompts to perform\\nactions. More recently, applications that can plan and operate more autonomously have\\nemerged:\\nAuto-GPT is a system for autonomous task execution, built on top of other GenAI models,\\nsuch as GPT. Unlike interactive systems such as U-M GPT, ChatGPT, Auto-GPT operates\\nwithout constant human input, by setting its own objectives to pursue, generating\\nresponses to prompts, and adapting its prompts recursively based on new information. It\\ncan autonomously perform several actions such as web searching, web form interactions,\\nor API interactions. As an early self-driven system for task execution, Auto-GPT is an\\nexample of an AI system that can not only perform tasks determined by human users, but\\nalso define its own tasks, a step forward toward more complex AI-driven autonomy and\\nproblem solving.\\nAutonomous GenAI tools have the potential to revolutionize numerous technological and\\nsocietal sectors. However, the deployment of unsupervised autonomous GenAI systems\\nalso introduces substantial technological challenges and societal risks, necessitating\\ncareful consideration and robust safeguards in their development.\\nLimitations and Risks\\n7/18/24, 1:38 PM\\nGenAI In-Depth: The Science and Capabilities of GenAI | U-M Generative AI\\nhttps://genai.umich.edu/in-depth/science-and-capabilities\\n3/5\\nThere are several risks and limitations that come with the use of GenAI. A few of these\\nrisks are listed below:\\nUnintended bias\\nGenAI models are trained on large language or vision datasets, which are often\\nreflective of multiple societal biases. These biases can be propagated in the\\ngenerated content, perpetuating and amplifying societal biases and prejudices.\\nMisinformation and disinformation\\nGenAI systems often produce misinformative statements and make unsupported\\nclaims. Their inability to provide a confidence level for the information they provide\\nmakes it difficult to determine when to trust these models. Further, these AI systems\\ncan be exploited to generate false or misleading information. The resulting\\nmisinformative content can have significant negative implications for trust, credibility,\\nand the manipulation of public opinion.\\nLack of transparency\\nBecause of being particularly complex, it is often challenging to interpret and\\nunderstand the current AI models. This lack of transparency can make it difficult to\\ndetermine how the model arrives at its generated outputs, which also makes it hard to\\nidentify biases, errors, or potential ethical issues, and hinders accountability.\\nPrivacy concerns\\nVery large amounts of data are typically needed to build AI systems, which can lead to\\na risk of privacy breaches and unauthorized use of personal information during data\\ncollection, storage, and utilization.\\nIntellectual property and copyright infringement\\nIn a similar vein, the use of very large datasets, and the functioning of generative AI\\nwhich often replicates patterns from the training data, can result in the unauthorized\\ngeneration or replication of copyrighted material.\\nEthical considerations\\nThere is a vast set of ethical considerations surrounding GenAI. In addition to the\\nrisks mentioned before, other ethical implications include the appropriate use of AI-\\ngenerated content, consent for data usage, potential impact on human creativity,\\nimpacts on labor markets and employment, and others.\\nExistential risk\\nA small yet growing fraction of technology leaders have articulated apprehensions\\nthat GenAI systems—and AI systems more broadly—represent a potential existential\\nthreat to society. This is predominantly attributable to the unpredictable\\n7/18/24, 1:38 PM\\nGenAI In-Depth: The Science and Capabilities of GenAI | U-M Generative AI\\nhttps://genai.umich.edu/in-depth/science-and-capabilities\\n4/5\\ncharacteristics of expansive AI algorithms and the potential for these systems to\\nautonomously optimize themselves, which could result in unanticipated and\\nundesirable consequences. Irrespective of one's position within the spectrum of these\\nconcerns, there is unanimous consensus that AI systems necessitate the\\nestablishment of stringent safeguards during their construction. Furthermore, it is\\nimperative that robust policies are instituted at various levels to mitigate the risks\\nassociated with these systems.\\nInformation and Technology Services\\nAbout ITS\\nSafe Computing\\nITS Service Status\\nWork at ITS\\nStay Connected\\n\\uf099\\n \\uf16d\\n \\uf167\\n \\uf08c\\nContact ITS\\nWolverine Access\\nOffice of the VPIT-CIO\\nU-M Website Privacy Notice\\n© The Regents of the University of Michigan\\n7/18/24, 1:38 PM\\nGenAI In-Depth: The Science and Capabilities of GenAI | U-M Generative AI\\nhttps://genai.umich.edu/in-depth/science-and-capabilities\\n5/5\\n\"}\n",
