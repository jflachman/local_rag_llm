# Project Proposal:

Implementation of a Local LLM for Document Review, Summarization, and Assistance



## Executive Summary

The goal of this project is to implement a Local Language Model (LLM) capable of reviewing, summarizing, and leveraging proprietary documents to facilitate document management tasks. The LLM will run on a laptop equipped with a 6GB RTX 3060 GPU and 32GB RAM. The system will take a list of files as input, provide answers to questions about these files, summarize the content, and assist in writing new documents based on the provided information.

This project will be reused after the class for developing documentation from existing proprietary documents at students current employer.

## Project Description

This project aims to enhance document management by leveraging an LLM to process and understand proprietary documents. The LLM will be integrated into a local system that will ensure data security and compliance with privacy regulations. The key functionalities of the LLM will include document review, question answering, summarization, and document creation assistance.

## Requirements and Constraints

-   **Hardware Specifications**:
    -   Laptop with 6GB RTX 3060 GPU
    -   32GB RAM
-   **Input Specifications**:
    -   Accept a list of files in various formats (e.g., PDFs, DOCX, TXT)
-   **Functional Requirements**:
    -   Ability to answer questions about the input files
    -   Ability to summarize the input files
    -   Ability to help write new documents based on the content of the input files

## Functional Requirements

1.  **Question Answering**:
    
    -   The LLM should understand and respond to factual and inferential questions about the content of the input files.
2.  **Summarization**:
    
    -   The LLM should generate concise summaries of the input files, capturing key points and essential information.
3.  **Document Assistance**:
    
    -   The LLM should assist in drafting sections of new documents, suggesting edits, and generating content based on the input files.

## Technical Approach

1.  **Model Selection**:
    
    -   Consideration of models such as GPT-3.5-turbo, DistilBERT, T5-small, or GPT-Neo, which are optimized for performance on resource-constrained hardware.
    -   Consider utilizing [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) for managing and deploying the chosen LLM. LM Studio provides tools to optimize and run language models locally, ensuring efficient use of hardware resources.
2.  **Implementation Plan**:
    
    -   **Data Preprocessing**: Develop a pipeline to convert input files into a format suitable for the LLM.
    -   **Model Inference**: Integrate the selected LLM to process the input files and perform the required tasks.
    -   **Output Generation**: Implement mechanisms to provide answers, summaries, and document drafts based on the model's output.
3.  **Optimization**:
    
    -   Apply model optimization techniques like quantization, pruning, and distillation to ensure efficient use of the hardware resources.

## User Interaction and Interface

-   Design a user-friendly interface, either as a command-line tool or a lightweight GUI, to facilitate interaction with the LLM.
-   Ensure usability features such as clear input prompts, progress indicators, and easy access to the generated outputs.

## Evaluation and Metrics

-   **Performance Metrics**: Measure the accuracy and relevance of the answers, quality of summaries, and usefulness of the generated document content.
-   **Efficiency Metrics**: Monitor the inference time and resource utilization to ensure optimal performance on the specified hardware.

## Security and Privacy Considerations

-   Implement robust security measures to protect proprietary information.
-   Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations and best practices for handling sensitive data.

## Timeline and Milestones

1.  **Phase 1: Research and Model Selection** (2 weeks)
    -   Evaluate suitable LLMs and select the best-fit model.
2.  **Phase 2: Implementation and Integration** (4 weeks)
    -   Develop the preprocessing pipeline, integrate the LLM, and implement the output generation mechanisms.
3.  **Phase 3: Optimization and Testing** (3 weeks)
    -   Optimize the model and conduct thorough testing to ensure performance and accuracy.
4.  **Phase 4: User Interface Development** (2 weeks)
    -   Develop and refine the user interface for ease of interaction.
5.  **Phase 5: Final Evaluation and Deployment** (2 weeks)
    -   Conduct final evaluations, address any issues, and deploy the solution.

## Budget and Resources

-   **Hardware Costs**: Utilization of existing laptop
-   **Software Costs**: Any necessary software licenses or subscriptions
-   **Personnel Costs**: Time and effort of the project team

## Team and Stakeholders

-   **Project Team**: Roles and responsibilities of team members, including data scientists, software engineers, and UI/UX designers.
-   **Stakeholders**: Identify key stakeholders and their interests in the project.

## Conclusion

This project aims to implement a robust, efficient, and secure LLM-based solution to enhance document management tasks. By leveraging advanced NLP capabilities, the LLM will provide valuable assistance in reviewing, summarizing, and generating documents, thus improving productivity and ensuring better utilization of proprietary information.
