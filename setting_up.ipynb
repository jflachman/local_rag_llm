      "Abstract: Many educators and professionals in different industries may need to become more familiar\n",
      "with the basic concepts of artificial intelligence (AI) and generative artificial intelligence (Gen-AI).\n",
      "Therefore, this paper aims to introduce some of the basic concepts of AI and Gen-AI. The approach\n",
      "of this explanatory paper is first to introduce some of the underlying concepts, such as artificial\n",
      "intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, artificial neural networks, and large language models\n",
      "(LLMs), that would allow the reader to better understand generative AI. The paper also discusses\n",
      "some of the applications and implications of generative AI on businesses and education, followed by\n",
      "the current challenges associated with generative AI.\n",

      "1. Introduction\n",
      "As the world experiences the Fourth Industrial Revolution, also known as Industry\n",
      "4.0, it becomes essential to understand the various technologies relevant to Industry 4.0.\n",
      "These technologies include, but are not limited to, artificial intelligence (AI), blockchains,\n",
      "digital twins, and edge computing. AI has gained much momentum in recent years, and\n",
      "the release of ChatGPT in late 2022 has added to this momentum. Generative AI may\n",
      "play a role in environments such as manufacturing by providing information support and\n",
      "enhancing robotics [ 1]. Many educators may need to become more familiar with some\n",
      "basic concepts and technologies associated with AI and generative AI. Therefore, this paper\n",
      "serves as a primer on generative AI.\n",
      "Simply put, generative AI generates content, which could be text, images, or multime-\n",
      "dia. However, one must understand some of the basic concepts before taking a deeper dive\n",
      "into generative AI. Hence, this paper starts with an explanation of AI and the relevant AI\n",
      "tools and techniques, followed by an introduction to generative AI (Gen-AI). Additionally,\n",
      "this paper briefly touches upon some of the applications of Gen-AI, followed by challenges\n",
      "and opportunities associated with Gen-AI and future recommendations.\n",
      "2. Artificial Intelligence\n",
      "We will start our discussion with the meaning of intelligence. There are several defini-\n",
      "tions and attributes of intelligence. Britannica defines intelligence as the “mental quality\n",
      "that consists of the abilities to learn from experience, adapt to new situations, understand\n",
      "and handle abstract concepts, and use knowledge to manipulate one’s environment” [ 2].\n",
      "While this may not be the absolute agreed-upon definition of intelligence, the definition\n",
      "mentions some critical concepts associated with intelligence. Many of the concepts asso-\n",
      "ciated with intelligence also apply to AI; therefore, as we take a deeper dive into AI, we\n",
      "should reflect upon the relevance of this definition to AI.\n",
      "Artificial intelligence (AI) has gained much momentum in recent years due to the\n",
      "advancements in hardware and software technologies. AI has several definitions, and some\n",
      "of them share similar attributes. Some of these definitions are listed as under:\n",
